# MONK CLI ANARCHY

## Executive Summary

**Terminal User Interface for monk-cli** - Professional Fallout-themed GUI providing comprehensive visual interface for monk API operations with enterprise-grade navigation patterns and real-time monk-cli integration.

### Project Overview
- **Language**: Python with Textual TUI framework
- **Purpose**: Visual terminal interface for monk-cli PaaS platform operations
- **Architecture**: 3-row layout framework with universal killbox notation and BaseVaultScreen inheritance
- **Integration**: Direct subprocess integration with monk-cli commands via JSON/YAML parsing
- **Distribution**: Terminal application with monk-cli dependency

### Key Features
- **Three-Step Authentication**: Server selection, tenant database selection, session management with existing authentication detection
- **Universal Killbox Notation**: [f/c/d/u] muscle memory across all vault facility modules for consistent navigation
- **AI-Powered Operations**: Global AI assistant accessible via '?' key for natural language vault operation guidance
- **Real-Time Integration**: Live monk-cli command execution with JSON/YAML response parsing and session management
- **Enterprise Navigation**: DataTable interfaces with dual navigation (arrow keys + ENTER or direct [1-9] selection)
- **Server-Scoped Architecture**: Logical separation of infrastructure, tenant databases, and authentication sessions

### Technical Architecture
- **UI Framework**: BaseVaultScreen inheritance pattern providing automatic header management and 3-row layout consistency
- **Navigation Patterns**: Killbox notation [key] for all hot key identification with non-looping boundary-aware movement
- **Data Integration**: monk-cli subprocess execution with structured JSON output parsing and error handling
- **Session Management**: Live JWT countdown with expiration detection and multi-server authentication context
- **Visual Design**: Vault-Tec Fallout aesthetic with professional terminal interface and responsive layout adaptation

### Vault Facility Modules

#### **Infrastructure Management**
- **Server Registry**: Multi-server configuration with health monitoring and connection testing
- **Tenant Management**: Server-scoped database registry with authentication status tracking
- **Session Control**: JWT-based authentication with existing session detection and context switching

#### **Data Operations**
- **Population Management**: Record operations with AI-powered filtering and natural language query conversion
- **Schema Laboratory**: Data structure design with JSON/YAML editing and version control
- **Advanced Search**: Filter DSL builder with English to database query translation

#### **Enterprise Features**
- **Global AI Assistant**: Context-aware help system with vault operation guidance and automatic module navigation
- **Security Protocols**: Observer system monitoring with real-time performance metrics (planned)
- **Audit Capabilities**: Command tracing and operation logging for enterprise compliance

### Installation & Quick Start
- **Prerequisites**: Python 3.13+, monk-cli installed globally
- **Setup**: Virtual environment with Textual dependencies
- **Launch**: `./run.sh` for complete authentication and vault access workflow

### Use Cases
- **monk-cli GUI Frontend**: Visual interface for all monk-cli operations and database management
- **Multi-Environment Management**: Development, staging, production server and tenant coordination
- **Enterprise Database Administration**: Visual tools for schema design, data operations, and user management
- **Developer Workflow**: Terminal-native interface for API development and testing with monk platform

### Archive Value
Excellent reference for:
- **Terminal UI Development**: Modern TUI framework architecture with Python Textual and enterprise navigation patterns
- **CLI Integration Patterns**: Subprocess command execution with structured output parsing and error handling
- **Enterprise Interface Design**: Professional terminal interface development with consistent user experience
- **Multi-Tenant Application UI**: Visual interface design for complex multi-server, multi-database architecture

Essential example of enterprise-grade terminal interface development demonstrating comprehensive monk-cli integration, professional navigation patterns, and scalable UI architecture for complex database platform management.
